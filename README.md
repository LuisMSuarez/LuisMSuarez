🚀 Seasoned Software Engineer | 20+ Years at Microsoft  
With over two decades of engineering excellence at Microsoft, I specialize in crafting software that transforms ideas into solutions. Whether it's automating complex tasks, solving persistent problems, or building engaging desktop and web applications, I thrive on turning code into impact.

🛠️ Languages & Frameworks I Love  
My repositories feature projects across C#, C++, TypeScript/React, and beyond—each showcasing usage of SOLID design principles, modular design & clean architecture.  
I also keep in mind performance and scalable design in every component and service I author.
